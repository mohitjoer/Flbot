# FLbuggy Bot

## Purpose

FLbuggy is a bot designed to assist in federated learning (FL) debugging. It helps identify common issues and potential bugs in FL setups, providing insights and guidance to resolve them. This bot aims to streamline the debugging process, making it easier for developers and researchers to build robust federated learning systems.

## Functionality

-   **Error Detection:** Identifies common errors in FL, such as client-server communication issues, data misalignment, and model aggregation problems.
-   **Debugging Guidance:** Provides detailed steps and suggestions for resolving detected issues.
-   **Performance Monitoring:** Offers insights into the performance of the federated learning process, highlighting potential bottlenecks.
- **Data pre processing**: assists in ensuring data quality.
-   **Configuration Validation:** Validates FL setup configurations to ensure they are correct.
-   **Log Analysis:** Analyzes logs from FL runs to identify root causes of errors.
